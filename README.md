A lightweight task + inventory management system with FastAPI (backend) and React/TypeScript (frontend).

## âœ¨ Features
- Task CRUD (create, edit, assign, due date, delete).
- Comment system (add, edit, delete).
- File attachments per task.
- React frontend with filters, task detail, activity feed.

- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite (dev mode).
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite.
- **Runtime:** Docker / Docker Compose.

## ðŸ›  Development
- bash
docker compose up --build

The API runs at http://localhost:8000.
Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000 (if using web service with Node).

Database

Default: sqlite:////app/data/app.db (mounted at ./backend/data/app.db).
